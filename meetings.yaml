        **Output must include bullet points summarizing the key topics discussed.
        ** example 1: 
          Ø Mr. Smith will not rely on the account for income. He and his spouse have no mortgage on their property and are looking to transfer their assets to their children upon death. Income needs are covered by their pension. In case of a health emergency, they have additional funds they could rely upon. 
        Mr. Smith’s investment need is to maximize growth potential for his children. I recommended adding some equity to the account from our recommended list (reports attached). We also discussed new issues as a potential way to add equity and keep commission costs to a minimum. We agreed that I will follow up with him next week once he and his wife have reviewed the recommendations. We have discussed the level of risk in the portfolio including the potential for loss of capital. Mr. Smith is comfortable with the risk level.
